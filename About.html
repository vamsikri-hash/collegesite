                    <p style="font-size: 19px">The dreams of its founding fathers took shape in 1984 in the form of Shanmugha College of Engineering, which is now renamed,
                        <u>SHANMUGHA ARTS, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY & RESEARCH ACADEMY (SASTRA)</u>. Our programmes, infrastructure, teaching-learning, etc., are among the country's finest. SASTRA has always been proactive in its academic planning and believes
                        in gaining the first-mover advantage. As a testimony to this, the Government of India has conferred the Deemed University status to SASTRA on April 26, 2001 under section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956. SASTRA offers various undergraduate
                        and post graduate courses in Engineering, Science, Education, Management, Law and Arts besides various Doctoral programmes and has state-of-the-art laboratories, a well stocked library and one of the best computing facilities.
                        With a sprawling campus having a built-up area of 2,22,129.02 square metre spread over 232 acres and a vibrant population of over 10,000 students and over 700 teaching faculty have made SASTRA a landmark in the educational map
                        of India.With an ideal teacher-taught ratio, we strive for academic excellence through personalized attention. The mechanisms established to support and monitor the student’s progress assure success and satisfaction. Since its
                        inception SASTRA has achieved national standing in terms of academic performance, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities and also in its growth and commitment to social service. The standards of excellence of our programmes
                        are reflected in the grades awarded to us by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council and in the success of our students in industry and academia, both in India & abroad. SASTRA has also been re-accredited with Grade ‘A’
                        (maximum) by the National Accreditation and Assessment Council (NAAC) a statutory body of U.G.C. SASTRA shapes its students' future by fostering a teamwork approach to instruction, encouraging interaction with faculty, providing
                        access to high tech information, motivating them to develop new ideas and concepts, taking personal interest in students' career development and preparing them for success.
